### I am a Plant Geneticist adventuring in the frontiers of bioinformatics and plant breeding

I am a plant researcher and Agronomist with a plus of 2 years of experience in research and data analysis in the industry. My skills include data analysis for the genetic improvement of forest species and self-pollinating plants, and bioinformatics applied to functional genomics focused on sugarcane. I have valuable skills in statistical analysis, bioinformatics, and plant phenotyping. With a comprehensive understanding of plant breeding programs, I have contributed to the development of key performance indicators and the implementation of innovative strategies. I have effective communication and interpersonal abilities by successfully organizing events, delivering lectures, and conducting training sessions. Additionally, I am fluent in English and well-equipped to thrive in international work environments.  

I am a motivated and creative scientist, and I appreciate collaborative work.   
  
Besides genetics and plant science, I enjoy learning about science communication, education, and project management.   

### Beyond work-life  

I am passionate about traveling and discovering new places, as well as observe nature. In my free time, I hike to discover waterfalls or enjoy some time on the beach. Besides that, I also enjoy writing poetry and learning to play the guitar.  
I love animals and I have two cats and one little tortoise.
