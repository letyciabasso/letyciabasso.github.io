__A Plant Geneticist adventuring in the frontiers of bioinformatics and breeding__

I am Ph.D Candidate in Genetics and Plant Breeding at University of São Paulo, and currently I am researching how sugarcane responds to drought stress. I am a motivated and creative scientist, and I appreciate collaborative work. I completed a Bachalor Degree in Agronomy in 2014 and a Master Degree in Genetics and Plant Breeding in 2017 at the Federal University of Goiás. I received a grant from Capes in 2012 to study agronomy in Iowa, United States for six months in 2012. Additinally, I was a member of the winner group of the Wikipedia ISCB competition in 2018. My skills inclue bioinformatics, experimental planning, statistical modeling and R programming.
